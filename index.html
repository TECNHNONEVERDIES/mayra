        <h2>Dear Mayra,</h2>
        <p style = "font-family : comic sans ms ;">Hey there, first of all, I'm sorry I wasnt able to get uu a physical gift, it was way too risky. So I tried my best on this website, I havent added stuff like "all of my thughts while i am awake and asleep is about uu" or something like that. I know its romantic and shit, but all of that stuff is just lies and i wanted this to be geniune and truthful. Its nothing much, I've been working on it for quite a while now, I hope uu like it.<br><br>

            Well, it only makes sense to start from the beginning, where it all started. I remember when I first started liking uu, I was sitting with shayan on the way back to school in seventh grade, and uu were sitting ahead of us. Shayan whispered "man, that girl ahead of us looks so cute." and I looked at uu and I'm liek "dayumn bro ur right". At that time, I'll admit, I did like uu for uur looks, but it was just liek, ehh, she looks nice, but tazeen ykyk. Ofc cuz we were sitting ahead of each other on the bench thing in school, we talked a lot. We talked a lot and one day I'm just liek, HOLY SHIT, I THINK I LIKE HER. uu already know my rating scale abt girls, and uu were a 10/10 on EVERY. SINGLE. SCALE. vibe, persona, and looks. frankly speaking, I still feel that uur way out of my league. But im not gonna complain that uur with me, its a good blessing to have.<br>
            Since that day, I had been legit tryharding to get even a scrap of uur attention (I legit got rejected four times). And finally, the day came, 23rd April, crushing on uu for OVER AN YEAR had finally paid off. Holy shit I was jumping around the house for a solif fifteen minutes after that. Ever since then, there's nothing I would change between us. all of the fights, quarrells, smiles, and texts we have shared, I wouldn't change a single thing. Cuz thats what led up to this, our relationship. God wouldn't be able to craft a finer, better, more loyal, gorgeous, cute, just a more AMAZING person than uu. Please dont leave me. I cry almost every time when I get a dream about uu dying, who cares about darkness or ghosts? My biggest fear is losing uu. I've never made so many fake scenarios in my head, good and bad, about a single person in my whole life.<br>
            uur the best I've ever had, and the best I will ever get. I've never felt more FULL than the times i'm with uu. Something just seems to connect. I know, we've had a lot of fights and petty little arguments, and thats fine, it gives us something to look back to. The part I liked the most was how we never took a small argument as a translation to "i dont love you" or "I hate you". Thank uu so much for staying with me, loving me, just being there for me in general. I've told uu things I havent even told my parents.I really dont know what I would do without uu. Thank uu so much for staying with me, even when there were OBVIOUSLY better guys than me out there who liked uu. Thank you for being my valentine, I couldn't ask for a better blessing than uu. <br>
            I still remember the way my heart raced the first time we called at night at the whole puja thing. Just hearing uur voice made everything feel so unreal, like my entire life had been building up to that moment. And then when uu laughed, oh my EFFING GOD, I swear I could feel something inside me just melt. If I could, I‚Äôd play uur laugh on repeat forever. It‚Äôs insane how one person can make everything feel so perfect, so right, just by existing. I don't even need to be doing anything special with uu, just sitting in silence with uu is better than anything else I could be doing.<br>
            Every single time uu do something that seems normal in any relationship, uu know, holding hands, saying I love uu, etc. I just internally explode. It's genuinely very hard to keep all of those feelings boxed in. I feel like the luckiest man on earth (Which of course I am). and THOSE INSTAGRAM REELS. EVERY SINGLE ONE MAKES ME BURY MY HEAD IN A PILLOW AND SCREAM. Every single small, seemingly insignificant thing uu do makes fills me up with a joy and passion for uu that i simply cannot describe in coherent words.<br>
            And uu know, sometimes I just sit and think about all the little things uu do. The way uu type, the way uu tease me, the way uu randomly send me something just to see my reaction. The way uur eyes light up when uur talking about something uu love. The way uu always make me feel like the luckiest person alive, even when I don't deserve it. I love uu for all of it, for everything uu are, everything uu do, and everything uu will ever be.<br>
            Sometimes I wonder how different my life would have been if I had never met uu, and honestly, I hate thinking about it. Cuz without uu, I wouldn‚Äôt be the person I am today. Uu have changed me in ways I never thought possible. Uu made me realize what it means to actually care about someone, to genuinely want to be better, not for myself, but for someone else. Uu taught me what love actually feels like, not just the idea of it, but the real thing‚Äîthe kind that makes my chest ache in the best way possible.<br>
            I love how even the smallest things remind me of uu. A song, a random word, a certain time of the day it‚Äôs like uur in almost every little corner of my life. And it‚Äôs insane how even when uur not around, uur still with me. I can hear uur voice in my head when I read uur texts, I can imagine uur reactions when I see something funny, and I always catch myself thinking, "I have to tell her abt this later" uu have become such a huge part of me, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.<br>
            Every moment with uu feels like it‚Äôs straight out of some dream I never want to wake up from. I swear, I could be having the worst day ever, but the second I talk to uu, it‚Äôs like all of it disappears. I don‚Äôt know how uu do it, but uu have this way of making everything feel okay, even when it‚Äôs not. Liek as long as I have uu, nothing else matters. Somehow, I got lucky enough to find love in uu.<br>
            I know I say this a lot, but I need to say it again: <strong>I love uu.</strong> More than I can ever put into words, more than I can ever show. And I swear, as long as I'm alive, as long as I can, I‚Äôll keep trying to be the person uu deserve. Cuz uu deserve the best, and I want to be that for uu. Always.<br>
            I didnt want this to just be a link to a message, so I put together four of my favourite memories with uu down here (beleive me, it was hard to decide). I know uu love listening to my playlist abt uu, so it's embedded neeche with the website. I really hope uu liked this, sorry if uu didn't. <strong>I love uu more than uu could ever imagine, my rasgulla</strong>‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
